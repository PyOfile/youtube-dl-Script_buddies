# youtube-dl-Script_buddies


### I have made this set of bash scripts to help use youtube-dl to download videos or mp3 of any youtube video without DRM protection on it(Like movies are protected for sure. But the first Rick & Morty Season 5 was not). With one interface and no need to remember the commands or more then one key bind when using something like i3.

You must have youtube-dl installed for any of these scripts to talk to it. It is a program that has gone through it in legal battles. Basically it seems that as of the time of this documentation 07/16/2021(I am not a law practitioner, therefore this is not legal advice), the courts have ruled it OK to use and not an act of piracy. It does have limitations like anyting. Im sure they will get mad and block you if you try to download nothing but DRM protected stuff, or if you hit their servers all day with requests. This is more if your daughter likes a video so much your bandwidth is at risk. Or if you need a book someone made into an audio book. I am for giving Creators their credit. If you like the content you use this script for, contribute in another way. Rather then just views.
